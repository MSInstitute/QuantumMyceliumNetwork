# Mycelial Computing

## Overview

An innovative approach to distributed computing inspired by fungal networks. This project implements biological computing principles using mycelial network patterns.

## Core Concepts

### Natural Computing Patterns
- Distributed intelligence
- Self-organizing networks
- Adaptive resource allocation
- Natural consensus building

### Implementation Features

```python
from mycelial_compute import MycelialNetwork

# Create network
network = MycelialNetwork(
    initial_nodes=100,
    growth_rate=1.618,  # Golden ratio
    adaptation_factor=0.1
)

# Deploy computational tasks
results = network.distribute_computation(
    task="data_validation",
    resources_required={"cpu": 0.5, "memory": 1024}
)
```

## Network Architecture

- Hyphal computing nodes
- Spore-based data transfer
- Nutrient-inspired resource management
- Growth-based scaling

## Applications

1. Distributed Computing
2. Network Optimization
3. Resource Management
4. Natural Load Balancing

## Research Background

- Based on studies of P. polycephalum
- Implements natural intelligence patterns
- Biomimetic scaling algorithms

## Integration Examples

```python
# Resource allocation
network.allocate_resources(
    priority_tasks=["validation", "consensus"],
    efficiency_threshold=0.85
)

# Network growth
network.adapt_topology(
    load_factor=0.7,
    growth_pattern="rhizomorphic"
)
```
